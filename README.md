# Windows-Project
My the third project on native JavaScript

For testing this project, you have to install this project on your PC, then you should open it in your code editor and install all node modules
(in Visual Studio Code just open the terminal and write this "npm i").
After installing all modules run this project with command "npx gulp"(on Mac OS "gulp") and that's all.

For testing forms, in file "gulpfile.js" you should write path to your local server and run gulp.
